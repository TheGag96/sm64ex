# Extended Moveset for SM64

This is a mod for Super Mario 64 that attempts to add various new moves for Mario from games like Sunshine and Odyssey without replacing any existing ones. The aim is for to have each addition be balanced, natural, fitting, and (most of all) fun to use. Many of these changes were inspired by (and in some cases direct recreations of) Kaze's moveset changes for Super Mario Odyssey 64 and Super Mario 64 Land, but there's some new stuff here too.

## Changes

* **Wall Slide** ([video](https://imgur.com/zBjdMZN)) - Works much like Sunshine. Your reflected angle going at the wall is maintained after jumping off, and firsties are still possible. Going at the wall too fast (e.g. by doing a long jump) will bonk, but you still have the opportunity to do the old-style wall kick input during it. It's like a skill check for those trying to wall jump with a lot of momentum.
* **Dive Hop** ([video](https://imgur.com/07gii0H)) - Taken from Sunshine (uses the same Y-speed values too!). Done by pressing B while belly sliding.
* **Ground Pound Dive** ([video](https://imgur.com/QQTZMSa)) - Taken from Odyssey. Press B while in ground pound to do a somewhat slow dive with a bit of height. This move was also added in Kaze's hacks, but I was never a fan of the fact that it put you at full speed - it obsoleted the normal dive almost entirely. Now its clear use is to get that last-ditch bit of height/distance.
* **Ground Pound Jump** ([video](https://imgur.com/xTkY8FH)) - Taken from Odyssey. Jumping just after landing from a ground pound will do a straight-up jump with a height between a backflip/sideflip and a triple jump.
* **Roll** ([video](https://imgur.com/letp7qt)) - Taken from Odyssey, trying to be as close to it as possible. You can enter it by crouching and pressing R. You can gain speed by repeatedly pressing R (star particles indicate a speedup). You can also enter it by holding crouch (Z) before landing after long jump or dive. Additionally, pressing R just after landing from a ground pound will start a roll with a great amount of speed. During the roll, you can press A to cancel into a long jump or B to cancel into a dive recover. Letting go of R will also cancel the roll after a short lockout period (which won't occur if you accidentally triggered roll from long jump or dive for a couple frames). Cancelling this way will lift your firm speed cap slightly until you switch actions (explained further below).
* **Spin Jump** ([video](https://imgur.com/tz71HgT)) - Taken from Sunshine. The way gravity works should be to-the-numbers accurate, but it goes as high as a ground pound jump. Perform it by rotating the control stick a little more than half a circle, then jumping. Remember that you can choose the direction you want to face after the jump just before pressing A. You can also turn almost any jump into a spin jump after the fact by doing a spin input. You cannot grab ledges during it.
* **Spin Pound** ([video](https://imgur.com/ysYiMTw)) - Adapted from Odyssey. Simply press Z during a spin jump. You'll immediately plummet down much like a normal ground pound. When you land, you'll face the direction you're holding with the analog stick. You can do this very quickly after spin jumping, and you can roll after landing just like a normal ground pound... Meaning yes, you can [bump](https://smo-speedrun.fandom.com/wiki/Spinpound) like you're doing an Odyssey speedrun!
* **Underwater Ground Pound (+ Stroke and Jump)** ([video](https://imgur.com/tgaRiM6)) - Taken from Odyssey. You can now do a ground pound underwater! This helps you descend into the depths faster. Additionally, if you press A during it, you'll do a stroke straight forward that's decently quick. If you land the ground pound underwater, pressing A will do an underwater ground pound jump. Ground pounding into water will now carry into the underwater version, and ground pound jumping underwater to the surface will carry into a jump out of the water.
* **Ledge Parkour** ([video](https://imgur.com/4C563j2)) - Adapted from Super Mario Run (of all places). When grabbing ledge when going at least full walking speed, pressing B within a 3 frame window will vault you over the ledge. It'll maintain your speed prior to grabbing ledge and give you a little bit more as well. If the level geometry was a perfectly-made set of stairs, you could continually parkour over each ledge, accumulating ludicrious speed in the process...
* **Modified Tight Controls Patch** ([video](https://imgur.com/67xK6i3)) - The Tight Controls patch by Keanine is a great idea - being able to easily change directions without doing awkward half/circles is a great idea. However, with this patch, if you're on the ground with a lot of backwards speed, pressing back will change your direction, but you'll still be going backwards in that new direction. This looks and feels very strange, so I've modified it to also convert your speed into forward speed when changing directions due to Tight Controls. Additonally, since it feels a little limiting to have a bunch of speed only for it to be limited by the hard walking speed cap, I've decided to significantly raise that hard cap and also turn the old cap into a "firm" cap. Over that "firm" cap, you'll lose speed twice as fast normal. Doing this maintains a bit of that feeling of riding the insane momentum backwards from a slope in vanilla while still getting the benefits of a more responsive normal control.

## Installation:

### PC Port

Just apply the `.patch` file from the Releases page in this repo like so:

```sh
git apply --reject --ignore-whitespace "Extended Moveset.patch"
```

Then recompile:

```sh
make -j16       # if your CPU has 16 cores
```

### N64 ROM

Apply the `.xdelta` patch from the Releases page in this repo onto a clean SM64 ROM using your favorite Xdelta patcher (e.g. some online one like [this one](https://hack64.net/tools/patcher.php) or [this one](https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/)).

If you have any bug reports, suggestions, etc. Please feel to let me know! Thanks for trying out the mod!

Original README begins below:

# sm64ex
Fork of [sm64-port/sm64-port](https://github.com/sm64-port/sm64-port) with additional features. 

Feel free to report bugs and contribute, but remember, there must be **no upload of any copyrighted asset**. 
Run `./extract_assets.py --clean && make clean` or `make distclean` to remove ROM-originated content.

Please contribute **first** to the [nightly branch](https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex/tree/nightly/). New functionality will be merged to master once they're considered to be well-tested.

*Read this in other languages: [Español](README_es_ES.md), [Português](README_pt_BR.md) or [简体中文](README_zh_CN.md).*

## New features

 * Options menu with various settings, including button remapping.
 * Optional external data loading (so far only textures and assembled soundbanks), providing support for custom texture packs.
 * Optional analog camera and mouse look (using [Puppycam](https://github.com/FazanaJ/puppycam)).
 * Optional OpenGL1.3-based renderer for older machines, as well as the original GL2.1, D3D11 and D3D12 renderers from Emill's [n64-fast3d-engine](https://github.com/Emill/n64-fast3d-engine/).
 * Option to disable drawing distances.
 * Optional model and texture fixes (e.g. the smoke texture).
 * Skip introductory Peach & Lakitu cutscenes with the `--skip-intro` CLI option
 * Cheats menu in Options (activate with `--cheats` or by pressing L thrice in the pause menu).
 * Support for both little-endian and big-endian save files (meaning you can use save files from both sm64-port and most emulators), as well as an optional text-based save format.

Recent changes in Nightly have moved the save and configuration file path to `%HOMEPATH%\AppData\Roaming\sm64pc` on Windows and `$HOME/.local/share/sm64pc` on Linux. This behaviour can be changed with the `--savepath` CLI option.
For example `--savepath .` will read saves from the current directory (which not always matches the exe directory, but most of the time it does);
   `--savepath '!'` will read saves from the executable directory.

## Building
For building instructions, please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex/wiki).

**Make sure you have MXE first before attempting to compile for Windows on Linux and WSL. Follow the guide on the wiki.**
